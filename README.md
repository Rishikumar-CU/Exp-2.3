This Experiment (2.3) showcases the use of Lambda Expressions and the Stream API in Java for performing common data processing tasks in a clean and functional way.
It demonstrates how modern Java features can simplify operations such as sorting, filtering, grouping, and aggregation without using complex loops or external libraries.

Included Programs

Part A – Employee Sorting:
Demonstrates sorting a list of employees by name, age, and salary using concise lambda expressions instead of traditional comparator classes.

Part B – Student Filtering:
Uses stream operations to filter students scoring above 75%, sort them by marks, and display their names in order.

Part C – Product Processing:
Shows real-world data handling using Collectors to group products by category, find the most expensive product in each group, and calculate the average price of all products.
